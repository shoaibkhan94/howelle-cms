Adoption is a beautiful process, where individuals can become parents to a child that they did not biologically conceive or give birth to. Adoption was earlier an option only couples who could not naturally conceive a child would opt for. Now it is becoming common for young couples to adopt a child to help give them a better life, even when they can biologically conceive a child. Many people today chose to be single parents, and use adoption as a way to fulfill their dreams. Many homosexual couples also chose to adopt kids instead of choosing surrogacy, sperm donation, and other similar methods. 

Adoption is becoming a suitable option for more and more young parents. Many individuals today choose to not have biological children, and want to adopt instead. They believe in giving a better life to a child who deserves it. But adoption comes with its fair share of legal, ethical, and psychological aspects.

### The Legal Aspects of Adoption

In India, there are a number of laws in place regarding the adoption process, and who is eligible to adopt a child. For any individual to adopt a child, where a married couple, or a single person, they have to be declared of sound mind and competent. 

People from Hindu, Jain, Sikh, and Buddhist religions can legally adopt children in India; where as, people from Christian, Muslim, Parsi, and Jewish religions can only become guardians, as presented under the Guardian and Ward Act, 1890. This is because their personal religions do not permit adoption, thus a separate act is provided for them, where they can become legal guardians of a child, until the child is 21 years old. 

Earlier, when a person already had a child of one particular gender, they were not given the permission to adopt a child of the same gender (Section 11). This was, however, changes when people objected and wanted to adopt a child of the same gender. 

To adopt a child, individuals must first register with the Child Welfare Agency. After they are interviewed, they proceed with the selection of a child. Finally, a petition is filed in the court, and the court issues a decree to complete the adoption process. 

### The Ethical Aspects of Adoption

The biggest issue that many people face is the waiting time. There are hundreds of people who are already in line to adopt a child, from years. To many this ends up becoming a extremely tedious task. Single parents, or those couples who can biologically have a child, are placed way below on the waiting list, and priority is usually given to those couples who cannot biologically have a child. 

The family of wanting to adopt a child should be competent enough to meet with their needs. This means that the parents, and any other members of the family, should be financially and emotionally competent enough to take in the child. A thorough check on the background of the parents, both financially and otherwise, is usually done before proceeding with the adoption process. This process automatically eliminates any individual who is under extreme financial pressure, or cannot take care of the child due to other financial reasons. Such steps do come across as discriminatory to many individuals. 

A lot of the times, couples and single parents alike, decide to not adopt from the fear of what society will say. Even though adoption is a beautiful process, the mentality that it is someone else's child runs rampant in the society. The Indian society, specifically, is extremely judgemental of people who cannot have biological child, who opt not to have biological children, and those who want to adopt a child without a partner. Fearing the reaction of not only outsiders, but also of family and friends, who would rather see them try to have a child biologically through the means of IVF, surrogacy, and the likes. 

People usually want to adopt really young children, so that they can be a huge part of the child's life. This leaves older kids with very few chances of being adopted, and having to spend up to 18 years in the child welfare system. This seems to be an unfair advantage for the younger children.
