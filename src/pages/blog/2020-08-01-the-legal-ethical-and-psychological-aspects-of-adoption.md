Adoption is a beautiful process, where individuals can become parents to a child that they did not biologically conceive or give birth to. Adoption was earlier an option only couples who could not naturally conceive a child would opt for. Now it is becoming common for young couples to adopt a child to help give them a better life, even when they can biologically conceive a child. Many people today chose to be single parents, and use adoption as a way to fulfill their dreams. Many homosexual couples also chose to adopt kids instead of choosing surrogacy, sperm donation, and other similar methods. 

Adoption is becoming a suitable option for more and more young parents.
