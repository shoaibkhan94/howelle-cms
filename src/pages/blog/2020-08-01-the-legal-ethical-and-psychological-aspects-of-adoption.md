Adoption is a beautiful process, where individuals can become parents to a child that they did not biologically conceive or give birth to. Adoption was earlier an option only couples who could not naturally conceive a child would opt for. Now it is becoming common for young couples to adopt a child to help give them a better life, even when they can biologically conceive a child. Many people today chose to be single parents, and use adoption as a way to fulfill their dreams. Many homosexual couples also chose to adopt kids instead of choosing surrogacy, sperm donation, and other similar methods. 

Adoption is becoming a suitable option for more and more young parents. Many individuals today choose to not have biological children, and want to adopt instead. They believe in giving a better life to a child who deserves it. But adoption comes with its fair share of legal, ethical, and psychological aspects.

### The Legal Aspects of Adoption

In India, there are a number of laws in place regarding the adoption process, and who is eligible to adopt a child. For any individual to adopt a child, where a married couple, or a single person, they have to be declared of sound mind and competent. 

People from Hindu, Jain, Sikh, and Buddhist religions can legally adopt children in India; where as, people from Christian, Muslim, Parsi, and Jewish religions can only become guardians, as presented under the Guardian and Ward Act, 1890. This is because their personal religions do not permit adoption, thus a separate act is provided for them, where they can become legal guardians of a child, until the child is 21 years old. 

Earlier, when a person already had a child of one particular gender, they were not given the permission to adopt a child of the same gender (Section 11). This was, however, changes when people objected and wanted to adopt a child of the same gender. 

To adopt a child, individuals must first register with the Child Welfare Agency. After they are interviewed, they proceed with the selection of a child. Finally, a petition is filed in the court, and the court issues a decree to complete the adoption process. 

### The Ethical Aspects of Adoption

The biggest issue that many people face is the waiting time. There are hundreds of people who are already in line to adopt a child, from years. To many this ends up becoming a extremely tedious task. Single parents, or those couples who can biologically have a child, are placed way below on the waiting list, and priority is usually given to those couples who cannot biologically have a child. 

The family of wanting to adopt a child should be competent enough to meet with their needs. This means that the parents, and any other members of the family, should be financially and emotionally competent enough to take in the child. A thorough check on the background of the parents, both financially and otherwise, is usually done before proceeding with the adoption process. This process automatically eliminates any individual who is under extreme financial pressure, or cannot take care of the child due to other financial reasons. Such steps do come across as discriminatory to many individuals. 

A lot of the times, couples and single parents alike, decide to not adopt from the fear of what society will say. Even though adoption is a beautiful process, the mentality that it is someone else's child runs rampant in the society. The Indian society, specifically, is extremely judgemental of people who cannot have biological child, who opt not to have biological children, and those who want to adopt a child without a partner. Fearing the reaction of not only outsiders, but also of family and friends, who would rather see them try to have a child biologically through the means of IVF, surrogacy, and the likes. 

People usually want to adopt really young children, so that they can be a huge part of the child's life. This leaves older kids with very few chances of being adopted, and having to spend up to 18 years in the child welfare system. This seems to be an unfair advantage for the younger children.

Adopting children who have special needs, are differently abled, and have specific mental and emotional requirements, is a difficult task. Parenting these children just the same way as one would parent a child without such characteristics is wrong. The special care and attention needed should be understood prior to the adoption. Abandoning these children after adopting them is the most difficult thing that they will face. The parents should keep their needs in mind and must make sure that they themselves are emotionally and mentally capable of parenting such children.

### The Psychological Aspects of Adoption

Adoption is a difficult process for both the child being adopted and the family adopting the child. It is the integration of an outsider into the family. This becomes even more complicated when the child is over the age of five or six, and has a much better understanding of the whole process. Adoption can have huge psychological impacts on everyone involved. 

When a family already has one or more children, and then decide to adopt, it can be difficult for the kids to get situated to each other and learn to deal with the divided attention. The children already in the family may easily adapt to the change, but if they don't, then they may learn to harbor resentment towards the adopted child. It becomes very important for the parents and other family members to make sure such resentment does not fester in the mind of any child. 

In many instances, the child adopted has a history of emotion, mental, and/or physical abuse. It becomes the duty of the parents to understand what the child has been through, how that has shaped him/her, and how that child might need space and patience at times. Overcrowding such children can prove to be extremely harmful.

The child might, at times, not be so willing to accept the new change in their life. They may get uncomfortable in the new environment, and more often than not feel like an outsider. This feelings can later manifest in the form of problematic behaviors, so the parents should keep an eye on things, and make the child feel as welcome as possible. 

The environment of a care home or an orphanage are wildly different. From living with many children and wardens, to living with only a few people, this transition can be very lonely sometimes. The family members must make sure that when the child feels lonely, or has a distant feel to them, they must make sure to engage them and provide them with the attention necessary.



Adoption by no means is an easy and simple process. It can be mentally draining and exhausting for everyone involved. But as complicated as it is, it can also be very rewarding for the child and the parents. The most important thing to be kept in mind is that every child is different, and every process is not the same, so keeping an open mind, learning all that is necessary and being adaptable is the key to a happy and healthy adoption process.
