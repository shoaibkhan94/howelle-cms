Coping is defined as the thoughts and behaviors used to manage the internal and external demands of situations that are appraised as stressful (Folkman & Moskowitz, 2004). For any given event or situation to be considered stressful, an individual's appraisal of it is taken into consideration. Some people may find the presence of an insect in their house as a stressful situation, while others may not think anything of it. 

Thus, coping is the process that comes into play when individuals perceive an event/situation as stressful. 

Human beings generally cope with any given situation, in one of two ways: focus on the problem, or focus on the emotions. Problem focused coping is used in situations that are perceived to be under one's control, such as, when there is a financial crisis. People start focusing on finding solutions to the problem presented to them. Emotion focused coping is used when a situation feels out of a person's control, when they believe nothing can be done, such  as, when a family member is diagnosed with a fatal illness. People start to focus more on dealing with their negative emotions and trying to calm their minds. 

Coping just as simple a process as it is complex. There are numerous coping mechanisms and stress management techniques that individuals can use to effectively deal with their stress, but the issue arises when they have to choose a particular mechanism. No two people have the exact same problems in life, thus thinking about one solution for all of them is pointless. Out of the many available options, individuals need to use the trial-and-error method to determine which method is the most effective for them. 

### Personality

An individual's personality plays a role in how they perceive a situation, and how they handle it.
