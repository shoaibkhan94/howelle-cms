A Tinder match of mine once asked me, “if your mind was a room, what would it look like?” An exciting question required an equally interesting answer. So, I started to think about the insides of my mind. The colors of the walls, the photo frames, the windows, the doors, the furniture and the items present in there. The Tinder guy was blocked, but his question still takes up a considerable part of my life.

My room of mind looked exactly like what I was feeling at that point in time. It had exactly what I enjoy, books, some instruments and a comfy bed to relax. I went on to ask the same question to my friends, some said the room is messed up, some had black walls, some had closed doors, and some had an open, well ventilated, sunshine gleaming through the windows kind of room.

Understanding our minds never seemed easier. Just open the doors, go inside and look around. What do you see? What do you feel like? Are you comfortable? Will you allow someone to come in and look around? All these are the questions to ask yourself in order to understand your innermost selves and then work upon self-growth. Self-growth is nothing but getting to know yourself well enough to work on further growth. Or going with our theory, clean up the room, and upgrade it. If you are stressed about something and see dark walls, think of how you’re going to paint the walls into a refreshing green. If you feel closed up, think about how you’ll add a big window to let your thoughts flow. If you’re feeling messed up and can’t let yourself to open up to people around you because you’re scared about the mess they’ll see and judge you for it, clean your room, the room your mind is now and then invite your friends over, open up to them. Even though your closest friends won’t mind seeing the messy, unorganized room as well too. (just saying!)

What you see is what others will see. If you are not in good terms with yourself, the outside world you’ll see will not be an appealing one as well. When we are busy thinking about the negatives, we’ll see the negatives. It’s like we are trapped in our darkroom and aren’t enabling the bright light of the world around us. In another case scenario, if we are thinking about the positives, we’ll more likely see the positive side of life. The doors and windows of our rooms will be open, welcoming the fresh air and the good vibes. Positive Psychology is not about thinking what you believe will surely happen but it is about keeping a positive attitude towards life, i.e., everything will eventually end up being the best for you, making you the best version of yourself.

A Hindi song says, “ yahaan rehne aayegi, dil saja lu, main khwaab thode se bun lu” (she’ll come here, let me decorate my heart, let me dream a little) the singer here is decorating the room of their heart for their lover. Go ahead, embellish, and welcome what your heart loves.
