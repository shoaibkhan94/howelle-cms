Anxiety is a negative mood state that is characterized by bodily symptoms of physical tension and by apprehension about the future (American Psychological Association,2000; Barlow,2002) Anxiety is an emotional state that occurs as a threatening event draws close. Physical feelings, thoughts, and behaviors are three key features of anxiety (Kearney and Trull,2012).

Fear and worry are often confused for anxiety by the general population, but they are not the same. Fear is an intense emotional state that happens as a threat is imminent or actually happening. Worry occurs in reaction to a potential danger, and the reaction is generally slow. Anxiety, on the other hand, is a reaction to an impending threat, and the reactions are more focused and quick. When worry anxiety and fear become severe, it is known as an anxiety disorder (Kearney and Trull,2012).

Anxiety disorders manifest in various forms in individuals; some may have a generalized anxiety disorder, while others may have panic disorder.

The different types of anxiety disorders are as follows:

* Generalized Anxiety Disorder – In this type of disorder, the anxiety is not focused on any particular event or situation, but instead, there are vague, prolonged, and unexplained, intense fears present in the individual.
* Panic Disorder – When individuals experiences recurring anxiety attacks that are accompanied by extreme terror, it is known as Panic Disorder.
* Phobia – Phobias are the irrational and unexplained fears related to people, objects, animals and events.
* Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder – OCD is a condition that is characterized by obsessive thoughts, on the one side, and compulsive behavior and rituals on the other. These compulsive rituals are performed to reduce the anxiety that is generated due to obsessive thoughts.
* Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder – PTSD generally occurs in an individual after they have been subjected to a traumatic event. These events could range from natural disasters and childhood abuse to severe accidents.

All these anxiety disorders have some common symptoms, as described in the DSM.

* Excessive worry or anxiety over events or are unexplained
* Restlessness or feeling on edge
* Difficulty in concentration
* Irritability
* High blood pressure and blood sugar levels
* Physical and emotional distress
* Increased heart rate and breathing

Significant causes of anxiety:

* Biological Causes – Increasing evidence shows that the tendency to be anxious is inherited. The tendency for panicking also has genetic components and, in many cases, runs in the family. Usually, certain environmental factors ‘turn on’ the genes that carry these components.
* Psychological Causes – Certain actions or events that take place in early childhood can get embedded in the psyche leading to the development of anxiety disorders. Past and present trauma, if untreated, can cause certain disorders and manifest in the form of anxiety.
* Social Causes – The social and cultural environment that and individual lives in can also become a huge trigger for anxiety, especially for those individuals that already carry the genetic or psychological component for it. Living in a toxic environment or working in an unhealthy and mentally exhausting workplace is one of the significant social causes of anxiety. Certain people face extreme distress dues to political, cultural, social, and environmental distress, which leads to the development of anxiety.
* Health Issues – The persistence of health issues and physiological illnesses can lead to the development of anxiety in many patients and their caregivers.
* Unhealthy or Toxic Relationships – Having harmful or toxic relationships with parents, siblings, friends, or a partner can lead to not only anxiety but many other psychological disorders. In many cases, these relationships leave individuals with a lot of mental trauma, impacting their mental health.

Treatment for Anxiety and Anxiety Disorders:

There are numerous ways to treat anxiety.

* Therapy – Therapy and counseling are some of the most effective ways of dealing with anxiety disorders, especially phobia and OCD. Therapists use various forms of therapies, from Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to Psychotherapy, to help patients treat anxiety.
* Medication – In many cases anxiety is manifested in such high levels that medication becomes essential to bring down the levels and help the individual function effectively.
* Yoga – Yoga has proven to be effective in dealing with not only anxiety, but also stress and depression. It helps in relaxing both the mind and body and is capable of reducing the anxiety levels.
* Meditation – Meditation is a highly recommended treatment for stress and generalized anxiety disorder. When a person is overthinking or has apprehension about unknown events, meditating can be especially helpful to help the mind calm down and relax, effectively putting a stop to overthinking and negative thoughts.
* Exercising – Exercising is proven to help the body come out of an anxious state by producing endorphins. These hormones help not only bring down the stress and anxiety levels but also elevate the mood of people with depression.
* Healthy Diet and Self-Care – Eating a healthy balanced diet, and cutting oneself off from toxic people and environments is also beneficial in treating anxiety. Taking some time out of work can help reduce stress levels and mentally rejuvenate the individual.

As seen hear, anxiety has various dimensions and causes, making it clear that no one treatment is one hundred percent effective for the entire population. But with the increasing number of individuals facing one or the other types of anxiety disorder, it becomes extremely important for both the society and the mental health experts to pay close attention to its cause and treatment. Anxiety disorder, though it can grow serious, is treatable, and individuals having it should not shy away from consulting a specialist and getting the necessary treatment.
