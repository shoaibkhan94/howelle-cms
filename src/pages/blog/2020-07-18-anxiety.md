Anxiety is a negative mood state that is characterized by bodily symptoms of physical tension and by apprehension about the future (American Psychological Association,2000; Barlow,2002) It is an emotional state occurs as a threatening even draws close. Physical feelings, thoughts and behaviours are three key features of anxiety (Kearney and Trull,2012).

Fear and worry are often confused for anxiety by the general population, but they are not the same. Fear is an intense emotional state that occurs as a threat is imminent or actually occurring. Worry occurs in reaction to potential threat and the reaction is generally slow. Anxiety on the other hand is reaction to a approaching threat and the reactions are more focused and quick. When worry anxiety and fear become severe, it is known as an anxiety disorder (Kearney and Trull,2012).

Anxiety disorders manifest in various forms in individual; some may have generalized anxiety disorder, while the others may have panic disorder.

The different types of anxiety disorders are as follows:

* Generalized Anxiety Disorder – In this type of disorder, the anxiety is not focused on any particular even or situation, but instead there are vague, prolonged and unexplained, intense fears present in the individual.
* Panic Disorder – When individual experience recurring anxiety attacks that are accompanied with intense terror, it is known as Panic Disorder.
* Phobia – Phobias are the irrational and unexplained fears related to people, objects, animals and events.
* Obsessive Compulsive Disorder – OCD is a condition that is characterized by obsessive thoughts on the one hand and compulsive behavior and rituals on the other hand. These compulsive rituals are performed to reduce the anxiety that is generated due to the obsessive thoughts.
* Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder – PTSD generally occurs in an individual after they have been subjected to a traumatic even. These events could range from natural disasters and childhood abuse to severe accidents.
