Soon after the coronavirus went global, the whole world changed. Millions of people fought against a common enemy on one end on the other economies plummeted every day. This Pandemic indeed changed our lives invariably. Excluding the dark side, had we not been living so we would definitely have missed a greater joy of our lives. Had we ever thought of being trapped indoors for 4 long months? Or having all the time on Earth to ourselves but no Vacations? Or equal indulgence in all house chores which we never ever thought of earlier?. Life was so different.

Varied families faced varied situations. Whereas 2020 showed us various colors from forest fires to plane crashes or earthquakes to social unrest. Life and death became more unpredictable. Everything comes with its own Boon and Bane, nothing ever comes for free in life, it always costs you something or the other. But this was nothing that any one of us could have expected.

Looking at it from a positive angle, the Nationwide lockdown in various parts of the country made people feel a greater rejoice in spending quality time with their families. People started to spend more time connecting with old friends, old acquaintances, long lost relations, and whatnot. The warriors on the forefront helped people in every possible way each one could, took good care of each other, and gratified over, but amusingly, all our topics of conversation in our daily lives floated around the same idea, i.e., cursing Corona or the year 2020.

But giving it thought had not been this Pandemic- The Dad working in an MNC would have never got so much time celebrating the mood swings of his little lad or had not been this Pandemic the child living away from home would have never stayed back at home for so long. The mother would have never rejoiced so much serving hot meals to the daughter who used to work day long in office.  WFH was all a myth until this Pandemic changed everything for us. People became more creative and tried doing new things. The laborers who toiled far away from home returned back to their hometown for safe shelter, although all of it wasn't smooth at all.

In this modern generation of gadgets, how many of us actually remembered the fun we had as kids playing outdoors or playing board games at home, this Pandemic made us try everything possible thing we could do to keep ourselves entertained. In this new era, we inevitably got so involved in our lives that we forgot that there is a sense of peace when you read a novel in your hand or recite stories to your children, or even there is a subtle joy in fighting trifles over the winner of the game. The dad got more time to understand the kids, and the kids got more time to accord with the new normal. We realized life is much more fun than we were actually enjoying before this phase. The happiness in the eyes of a father seeing her daughter doing the most productive things was something that was far lost in our rat race. Definitely, the most magnificent jubilation had each other's back.

Since time immemorial, 'Families' have enjoyed closure and happiness in the little things of life, be it enjoying a delicacy or fighting the most difficult times together. This Pandemic brought everything to our plate. It would be wrong to decline that there was no bitterness, but with a heart full of elation, there was much more Boon to it than the Bane. Society entered a new era. The way we used to work changed, everything possible now has gone digital or being done over online platforms. The lines in public offices or banks have reduced, although it will take some time to adjust for all. Meeting friends over a video call is the new reunion, and maintaining distance is the new norm. Life is altogether running on a new track.
