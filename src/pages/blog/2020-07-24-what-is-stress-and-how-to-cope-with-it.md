Stress  is a negative emotional experience, accompanied by predictable biochemical, physiological, cognitive, and behavioral changes that are directed either towards altering  the stressful events, or accommodating for its effects (Taylor, 2009).

Stress is usually a negative emotion or feeling that brings about many emotional, psychological and physiological changes in an individual. This type of negative stress is known as distress, which can be harmful for the human mind and body. But stress can also be positive. The minimum amount of stress that is essential to motivate an individual is known as eustress. Eustress is that slight feeling of nervousness before an exam or a first date. 

**Effects of Stress:**

Distress can have many dangerous effects, both physically and mentally, on an individual. From health issues to drastic changes in the mood and behavior are all common effects of stress.
